# Impostor (work in progress)
Configurable and extendable mocking server implemented in pure Python.

It can mock HTTP/REST interfaces. (to do: XML-RPC, SOAP maybe)

Runtime re/configurable using JSON confs and directory structure.

Could be highly insecure! Do not run publicly unless you know exactly what you are doing. :)

See rich [directory setup example](https://github.com/vvendigo/impostor/blob/master/root/setup.json)

## How to run:
The only prequisity is Python (>=2.6?)

Download repo and run ./server.py
